Just download the files or clone the repo. The script is written in PHP so you will need a PHP webserver like WAMP/XAMPP. No Database required.

The Demo has 3 scenarios:
1)When the profile and cover images are served directly. You can see the page source and open the image directory.
2)When the images are served by an image controller and arguments are taken from user. Only works if logged in.
3)Image controller without any user arguments. Securest way.
